# Math 460/872 Assignment 1

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to
- Set up a Codespace
- Get some experience with Lean 4
- Define some structures

### Part 1
The files MoP-1 and MoP-2 contain worked examples and exercises from _Mechanics of Proof_, an online book by H.R. MacBeth which you can access here: [Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/index.html). Some examples are incomplete because they use the `sorry` tactic. You will supply the proofs of the following 6 examples:

### Part 2
To start leanifying Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory (ACT), you will filling in the blanks left in `act.lean`. Currently, this file is a skeleton of ACT chapter 1.
You must
1. Set up a namespace
2. Define a partially ordered set
3. Define a monotone function
4. Prove the identity is monotone
5. Prove the composition of two monotone functions is monotone
