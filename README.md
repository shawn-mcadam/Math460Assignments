# MATH 460/872 Assignments
### Computer-Aided Mathematics: Category Theory in Lean 4

This repository contains the assignments and starter files for MATH 460/872. The existing MATH 460 assignments can be found in `Assignments/`. To work using Lean, you can use Codespaces (easy) or install Lean locally (hard). The benefit of using a GitHub Codespace is that your project will _just work_. 

To set up a Codespace, ensure you're logged-in to Github, click the button below, select `2-core`, and then press `Create codespace`. After a few minutes, an editor with Lean working will open in your browser.

Your Codespace is frequently saved to the cloud, and you can access your existing Codespaces here [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). The downside of using a Codespace is that you can only have them active for 60 hours/ month for free. After that point, it's 0.18/hour. Before you hit that time limit, we'll figure out something for future assignments! 

This repo is also a fork of Glimpse Of Lean, an introduction to theorem proving in Lean for the impatient.
Going through the files in `GlimpseOfLean/` should give you a feel for what proving in Lean looks like in 2 or 3 hours.
When going through `GlimpseOfLean/` start with `Introduction.lean`, then read the explanations and exercises in
`GlimpseOfLean/Basics/` folder, and then you can work on a file from the `Topics` folder. You can read more about GlimpseOfLean here: [https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean)
